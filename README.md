> WORK IN PROGRESS

A image compression library written in pure rust. This library aims to implement
multiple lossy and lossless image compression algorithms.

## To do

- [ ] Implement basic structure
- [ ] Implement algorithms for JPEG, PNG, maybe others
- [ ] Implement algorithms for GIF
- [ ] Look at parallelization of these algorithms
- [ ] Create an CLI to wrap the library
